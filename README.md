# Ticket Management System

Iâ€™m super excited to share my latest projects: Curdearm Bank ticket management system. 

Technologies used are React JS, Tailwind CSS and Rechart 

The system is built for customers and admins. 

For customers: 

1. You enter your phone number and get a confirmation message. 
2. Choose the type of transaction you want to do. 
3. A ticket is printed. 

For Admin: 

1. You enter your ID and password to be able to log in. 
2. The Admin page shows all the types of transactions and number of tickets printed for each. 
3. A pie chart built with rechart to summarize the transactions. 
4. A bar chart also to visualize the number of transactions. 

This project has really tested my react js skills and also taught me how to visualize data using rechart. I would love to hear your thoughts on my project and any improvements you think is necessary.
